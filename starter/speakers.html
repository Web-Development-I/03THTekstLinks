        <p>Carolyn Chandler</p>
        <p>The Business of Play</p>

        <p>
          Play isn't just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare
          account knows that - and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard.
          But a good, playful user experience isn't about those surface elements
          either - it's about creating an environment with well-understood
          rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you're
          trying to encourage people - or yourself - to save money or to lose
          weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card
          you're looking for.
